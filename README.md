# Realtime Data Streaming | End-to-End Data Engineering Project

## Introduction

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline. It covers each stage from data ingestion to processing and finally to storage, utilizing a robust tech stack that includes Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, and Cassandra. Everything is containerized using Docker for ease of deployment and scalability.

## What I've done

- Setting up a data pipeline with Apache Airflow
- Real-time data streaming with Apache Kafka
- Distributed synchronization with Apache Zookeeper
- Data processing techniques with Apache Spark
- Data storage solutions with Cassandra and PostgreSQL
- Containerizing your entire data engineering setup with Docker
